# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to display the relationships between city types, number of drivers and total fare amounts to improve accessibility in places where there are an inadequate number of drivers and to ensure affordable pricing for passengers. This analysis data is based from the Pyber apps dates of January to May 2019.

## Results 
### Totals

The total amount of rides for the city types rural (125), suburban (625, andurban (1625). Displaying that the total amount of rides for urban city types were respectively 13 times and 3 times of rural and suburban city types.From this the Urban city type data is shown to have 7 times the number ofdrivers of the suburban city type and 111 times more drivers than the rural city type. The total fares of each city type are $4327.93(rural), 19356.33(suburban), and 39854.38 (urban). Once again urban city type had the highest amount, respectively with drivers profiting 9 times and 2 times of rural and suburban city types. 

### Ratios 
The total rides for Rural 125 with an amount of 537 drivers leaving a ratio of for every driver there are 4 rides (1:4). In the suburban area for the total amount of drivers is 8570 with a total of 625 rides with a ration of 1:13 or for every driver they’re 13 rides. The total rides for Urban areas are 1625 with an amount of 59602 drivers leaving a ratio per driver there’s 36 rides (1:36). 

### Average Ride and Driver Fares
Even though from the data above it would seem that urban drivers would make significantly more on average, in fact they don’t. The average driver in urban city types make .67 cents and $24.53 per ride. While suburban drivers on average make $2.26 and $30.97 per ride. Rural drivers make $8.06 on average and $34.62 an average per ride. Supply and demand come into effect here and with the extremely high number of drivers in urban city types against riders. The only way to compete is to lower your prices, as rural drivers don’t have to do as much as there isn’t a huge g ap between the average number of total rides and total drivers.   


## Summary
### Recommendations

Based on the results I would suggest looking more into what’s the typical population like in each city type. This could lead to discovering why urban areas have more rider than rural as well as what is location in those cities as more populated areas have more places to go to. Another suggestion is to create a survey and the collect the data of why grouped based on city types riders choose to use services such as Pyber. Final recommendation would be to look into each city types peak points and figure out why that month is higher than usual and then create a sale promotion around that time to give more a push to influence potential riders to use Pyber services.
